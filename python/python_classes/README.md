# Following along

We're exploring classes in Python in order to make our "user credits" code better.

The files are numbered, 0-7, e.g. `creds0.py`, `creds1.py`...
Each of these modules solves the same problem, with each successive module improving on the solution.

- [`creds0.py`](https://github.com/cfmeyers/classes/blob/master/python/python_classes/creds0.py)
- [`creds1.py`](https://github.com/cfmeyers/classes/blob/master/python/python_classes/creds1.py)
